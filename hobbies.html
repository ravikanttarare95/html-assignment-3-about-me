    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    I love to do so many things but I'm going to explain about my 2 hobbies only.<br />
    <h2> 1. <u>Listening to music</u> </h2>
    Listening to music is a fun and relaxing way to spend time. <br><br />

    <h3>Benefits of listening to music</h3>
    <b>Stress relief:</b> Listening to music can help reduce stress and anxiety by lowering cortisol levels. <br><br>
    <b>Mood boost:</b> Music can trigger the release of dopamine, which can make you feel more optimistic, joyful, and
    inspired. <br><br>
    <b>Improved focus:</b> Music can help improve your productivity, attention, and focus. <br><br>
    <b>Better sleep:</b> Listening to music can help you sleep better. <br><br>
    <b>Conversation starter:</b> Music can be a great way to start a conversation with someone who has similar taste in
    music. <br><br>
    <b>Imagination stimulation:</b> Music can transport you to another time and place, stimulating your
    imagination.<br><br>
    <h2> 2. <u>Cooking </u></h2>
    My opinion is that cooking is the best hobby to have, because it can be very useful in life. Cooking is my hobby and
    has been for several years. <br><br />

    How did cooking become my hobby?<br>
    I was about 16 years old when I started learning how to cook. Cooking is something that I learnt from my mother.
    When I was about to enter into 11<sup>th</sup> standard, I joined a coaching class for 11<sup>th</sup> &
    12<sup>th</sup> standard. I used to live in a rental room in those days. After some days I started to learn cooking
    and learned to cook 2-3 vegetables. Those days, I used to ask my mother about recipes & cook every day, and
    eventually it became my hobby.<br />
    But now the main reason I love to cook is because it keeps me stress-free. For example, when I am cooking, I have
    very little time to think, because the cooking is challenging my mind and taking my mind off the stress of everyday
    life. <Br />
